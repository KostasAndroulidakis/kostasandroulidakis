## Kostas Androulidakis

Currently learning **Python**.

I realized that **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science** fascinates me more than music.

Before that, I spent twelve years in the music industry, earning some **Gold** and **Platinum Records**.

And in the beginning, I studied **Audio Engineering** at SAE Institute Athens.
