## Kostas Androulidakis

Currently learning **Python**.

Before that, I realized that **Electrical Engineering and Computer Science** fascinates me more than music.

And before that, I spent twelve years in the music industry, earning some **Gold** and **Platinum Records**.

And before that, I became a **Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist**.

And in the beginning, I studied **Audio Engineering** at SAE Institute Athens.
